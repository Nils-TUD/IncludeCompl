Include Completion
==============

This plugin for Sublime Text 2/3 adds completion for include files. That is, if completion is
triggered while the cursor is within a C/C++ include statement, it offers completions for available
files. This is based on the include paths given by -I command line arguments in some setting
(configurable). It is recommended to use this plugin in combination with Clang-Complete or
SublimeClang, though not required.
